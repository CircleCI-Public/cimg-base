**Describe the Feature Request**
Please describe the feature request.

**Is your feature request related to a particular problem?**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is.

**How will this feature request benefit CircleCI jobs using this image?**
For example, will it help speed up jobs significantly by not having to install a commonly used package every run?

In order for us to add a tool within the image, it has to be something that is maintained and useful to a majority of CircleCI users. Every tool added makes the image larger and slower for all users, so any new additions need to be carefully thought out.

**Describe the solution you would like to see**
A clear and concise description of what you would like to see for this feature request. For example "I like like to see xyz package installed by default in the image".

**Describe alternatives you have considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions you have considered, such as different packages or workarounds.
